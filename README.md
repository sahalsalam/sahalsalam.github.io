## MY Fablab Documentation

+ **ABOUT ME** 

I'm a final year student of B-tech Mechanical engineering at MES college of engineering,
Kuttippuram. As iam doing a crash course on fablab, i would like to share my thoughts and 
experiances through this page. Check this page to more on 3D printer, vinyl cutting, pcb 
milling & laser cutting machine.

+ **ABOUT FABLAB**

A fab lab a.k.a fabrication laboratory is a small-scale workshop which is equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make almost anything.This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.
