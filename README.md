## MY Fablab Documentation

+ **ABOUT ME** 

I'm a final year student of B-tech Mechanical engineering at MES college of engineering,
Kuttippuram. As iam doing a crash course on fablab, i would like to share my thoughts and 
experiances through this page. Check this page to more on 3D printer, vinyl cutting, pcb 
milling & laser cutting machine.

+ **ABOUT FABLAB**

A fab lab a.k.a fabrication laboratory is a small-scale workshop which is equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make almost anything.This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.

There are 42 fablab in india now, out of which 20 of them are in kerala.MESCEFABLAB is one of this 20 mini fablab, where the students have the oppurtunity to explore the FAB world.

+ ### 3D PRINTING

 3D printing is when 3D solid objects are made from a model on a computer. 3D printing is done by building up the object layer by layer. It is an additive manufacturing process used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read.

 Once completed a required modelusing a software, the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a slicer, which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer. This G-code file can then be printed.

+ ### VINYL CUTTING

A vinyl cutter is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well. The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.

+ ### CNC MILLING

CNC milling is a specific form of computer numerical controlled (CNC) machining. Milling itself is a machining process similar to both drilling and cutting, and able to achieve many of the operations performed by cutting and drilling machines. Like drilling, milling uses a rotating cylindrical cutting tool. However, the cutter in a milling machine is able to move along multiple axes, and can create a variety of shapes, slots and holes.

+ ### LASER CUTTING

Laser cutting is a precise method of cutting a design from a given material using a CAD file to guide it. There are three main types of lasers used in the industry: CO2 lasers Nd and Nd-YAG. This involves firing a laser which cuts by melting, burning or vaporizing your material. Fine level of cutting can be achieved on a wide variety of materials. Since CO2 lasers canâ€™t cut metals and hard materials, they can however engrave on the material. Raster is used for engraving things, while vector is much more adept for cutting.
